> **[Chinese Version / 中文版](./README.md)**

> **Notice:** This project is under active development with rapid iteration focused on improving analysis quality. It has **not yet reached production readiness**. The web dev build and desktop installers are provided for **early preview only** — analysis results may contain significant errors. Feedback is welcome, but please do not rely on the output for formal academic research or literary analysis.

**Open-source AI novel analysis tool** — Upload any TXT/Markdown novel and let AI automatically extract character relationships, location hierarchies, and event timelines, generating interactive knowledge graphs, world maps, timelines, and more. Supports local Ollama and cloud LLMs. 100% local data storage, no telemetry.

## Key Features

### 🕸️ Character Relationship Knowledge Graph

Force-directed relationship network with 70+ relation types automatically detected, colored by 6 categories (family, intimate, hierarchical, social, hostile, other). Smart entity alias merging, path finding, category filtering, and edge weight adjustment.

### 🗺️ Auto-Generated World Map

Fully automated multi-layer interactive world map built from novel text. Supports multiple spatial layers (celestial/underworld/underwater/pocket dimensions), portal connections, procedural terrain (biomes, rivers, roads, continental shelves), character trajectory animation, and rough.js hand-drawn style rendering. **v0.58: Cross-chapter spatial completion + adaptive spatial scale (9 canvas levels) + smart redraw.**

### ⏳ Multi-Lane Timeline / Storyline View

Multi-source event aggregation (character appearances, item transfers, relationship changes, organization events), intelligent noise filtering, emotional tone badges, auto-collapsing chapters. Storyline swimlane view tracks parallel character narratives.

### 📖 Novel Encyclopedia

Five entity types with categorized browsing (characters, locations, items, organizations, concepts), location hierarchy tree with spatial relationship panel, scene index for source text lookup, world structure overview.
